# Machine-learning-Gaussian-Naive-Bayes

In this project, a program for the classification of handwritten digits based on Gaussian naive Bayes approach is explained. In
order to implement the program, python programming language is used. For training and testing the classifier the program used
MNIST dataset. It implemented the training procedure by calculating mean and standard deviations of all pixels (attributes) of all
classes (digits) from the MNIST training dataset. The testing procedure used MNIST test dataset and could correctly predict the
digits up to an extent.
